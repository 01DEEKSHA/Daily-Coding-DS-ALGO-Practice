# Title 
Fenced Matrix Problem
# Short Description 
We are given two positive integers m and n.
We have to make a list of lists (which can be visualised as a matrix) of size m*n, that is m sublists (rows), with each sublists having n integers (columns). 
The matrix should be such that it should have 1 on the border and 0 everywhere else. 

The Problem helps one to understand use of lists, list comprehension and differentiates deep and shallow copy.
